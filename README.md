# Colorpicker ðŸŽ¨

A multi format Colorpicker built with Svelte. The Colorpicker accepts and sets hex(a), rgb(a) and hsl(a) colors.

### Features

- Choose your color by clicking or dragging on a palette.
- Set the hue and opacity of your chosen color using Slider controls.
- Convert your selected color to your preferred color format (hexa, rgba, hsla).
- Set your color by typing into an input.
- A swatch panel for keeping track of recent colours or for passing favourite colors so they can be easily set again.
- Handy keyboard events to tab through control panel, set colors and close the Colorpicker.
- Colorpicker anchors to its preview element which displays the selected color and acts as a button to display the Colorpicker.
- Viewport positional awareness - the colorpicker centers by default but will adapt and position itself appropriately based on available space.
- Colorpicker renders outside the dom structure which prevents problems with overflow clipping in scrolling containers.

### Installation

1. Navigate to your project in the terminal.
2. Run `yarn add @budibase/colorpicker`.
3. Or use npm `npm i @budibase/colorpicker`.

### Usage

```javascript
import Colorpicker from "@budibase/colorpicker"

<Colorpicker
  //must be a valid color supported by Colorpicker (hsl(a), hex(a) or rgb(a))
  value="#abc"
  //An array of 12 or less swatches for use in the Colorpicker panel.
  swatches=["#abc2", "rgba(255,2,100,0.5)", "hsl(360,50,50)"]
  //disable swatches for the Colorpicker. Defaults to false
  disableSwatches={true | false}
  //Open or close the Colorpicker. Defaults to false
  open={true | false}
  //width of the Colorpreview. Defaults to 25px
  width="25px"
  //height of the Colorpreview. Defaults to 25px
  height="25px"
  //change event - invoked when color has been selected
  on:change={selectedColor => {}}
  //remove swatch - invoked when swatch has been removed
  on:removeswatch={removedSwatch => {})}
  //add swatch event - invoked when a swatch has been added
  on:addswatch={addedSwatch => {}}
  />
```

### Events

The Colorpicker exposes the following events. In each case, the color will be provided as the first parameter to the bound function.

**Change Event**
`on:change={selectedColor: string => {}}`
The on change event will be invoked whenever a color has been set in the Colorpicker via the palette, the hue slider, the alpha slider or by typing into the input.

**Add Swatch**
`on:addswatch={addedSwatch: string => {}}`
The add swatch event will be invoked when a user adds a swatch by clicking the add button.

**Remove Swatch**
`on:removeswatch={removedSwatch: string => {}}`
The remove swatch will be invoked when a user clicks the delete button that appears when hovering over a swatch.

### Swatches

- By default, added swatches are saved to local storage so that they can be displayed across all Colorpickers in your application.
- Only 12 or less swatches can be displayed in the Coloricker at any any one time.
- If more than 12 have been passed the Colorpicker will display the first 12 and warn in the console.
- An array of swatches can be passed to the Colorpicker to set up a dedicated panel of swatches. This will use provided swatches instead of locally stored swatches. Swatches added will still be saved to local storage.
- You can disable swatch functionality by passing the `disableSwatches={true}` property to the Colorpicker.
