# rollup-plugin-svelte-hot

This is a fork of official [rollup-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-svelte) with added HMR support.

It supports HMR both with [Nollup](https://github.com/PepsRyuu/nollup), or [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) with (experimental) [rollup-plugin-hot](https://github.com/rixo/rollup-plugin-hot).

## TODO

A new version of this plugin has been published to close the gap in API with rollup-plugin-svelte@7+.

README needs to be reviewed and updated, with new API from [last versions of rollup-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/blob/master/README.md).

Please refer to the [legacy README](https://github.com/rixo/rollup-plugin-svelte-hot/blob/v0/README.md) for information about the previous versions of this plugin (that supports rollup-plugin-svelte v4-5 API).
